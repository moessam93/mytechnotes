# MyTechNotes

A curated collection of technical notes, summaries, and implementation guides from podcasts, courses, articles, and real-world experience. Covers backend engineering, API security, software design, cloud, and best practices in C#, Python, DevOps, and more.

This repo is my personal reference and a living knowledge base. Notes are written in Markdown, often with code examples, diagrams, and “quick answer” sections for interviews and practical work.

Feel free to browse, fork, or contribute suggestions!

Topics include:
- API Security (OAuth2, JWT, mTLS, etc.)
- Clean Code & Design Patterns
- Cloud & DevOps (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Practical Backend Tips (.NET, Python, FastAPI)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Real-world Interview Prep
- …and more
